Vector cross-product (for 2D/3D)
Give wrappers support for all extension functions
Covert a vector of one type to another (via casting or func)
Check vector equality
Verify operator compliance for Vector<>[,]
Reduce necessity for operator compliance as much as possible (and make a list of all neccessary operators)

Add Matrics Applications:
Matrics.Application.MachineLearning
Matrics.Application.Physics (For when I learn matrix applications in physics)
Matrics.Application.Economics (I'd probably miss a lot of stuff here but I can add what I already know)
+ I'm sure matrics could provide specialized functions for more subject areas!

Add Matrics Integrations: (these are low priority)
Matrics.Integration.MathNet
+ Other stuff?
